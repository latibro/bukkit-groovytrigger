Bukkit GroovyTrigger Plugin
====================

This is at plugin for the Minecraft server Bukkit (<http://bukkit.org>).

It makes it possible to execute Groovy (<http://groovy.codehaus.org>) script, when different events occur on the Bukkit server.

By using Groovy as script engine, only the Bukkit API sets the limits of possibilities, as Groovy has assess to the full Bukkit (Java) API.

First focus is to be able to trigger script execution on player interaction with a block.
